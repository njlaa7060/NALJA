At this time, the whole world is dealing with each other directly, whether through social or cultural media spread through the Internet, and sometimes files are exchanged between users via the Internet. And since it is necessary to deal quickly to save time and effort, there must be a means used to translate files between different languages for users. Therefore, in this proposal, we have provided a new system that facilitates interaction between users, where the user of the proposed form can upload files to the proposed system and then the site provides quick translation of the file. The proposed model was also supported by the possibility of obtaining an explanatory video of the sentences in the file in the form of links. The user can view these videos to learn more about the meaning of the sentences. For more ease, we have supported the form with the ability to share translations with other people registered in the proposed form.Finally, the proposed model has been programmed and developed to be in line with the requirements of the times, considering in the first place the spread of interest among the users of the model in general and the provision of all the possibility of quick access to the contents of files and others. We hope that this will help many people.
